## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Price Prediction
```python
# Example house features
house_features = {
    'bedrooms': 3, 'bathrooms': 2.0, 'sqft_living': 1800,
    'sqft_lot': 7200, 'floors': 1, 'waterfront': 0,
    'view': 0, 'condition': 3, 'grade': 7,
    # ... additional features
}

# Predict price
predicted_price = predictor.predict_price(house_features)
print(f"Predicted Price: ${predicted_price:,.2f}")
```

### Multiple Predictions
```python
# Predict multiple houses
houses_list = [house1_features, house2_features, house3_features]
predictions = predictor.predict_multiple(houses_list)
```

## 📊 Model Performance

### 🎯 Performance Metrics
- **R² Score**: 0.65-0.75 (explains 65-75% of price variance)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: ~$85,000-120,000
- **Root Mean Square Error**: ~$120,000-150,000
- **Cross-validation**: Consistent performance across different data splits

### 🏆 Top 5 Most Important Features
1. **Living Space (sqft_living)**: Primary price driver
2. **House Grade**: Quality/construction rating
3. **Location (lat/long)**: Geographic price variations
4. **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms
5. **Waterfront**: Waterfront property premium (~150-200%)

## 📈 Model Pipeline

### 1. 🔍 Data Exploration
- Dataset overview and statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Feature distribution analysis

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Remove unnecessary columns (ID, date)
- Handle outliers using IQR method
- Feature engineering and creation

### 3. 🔧 Feature Engineering
```python
# Created features:
- house_age = 2025 - yr_built
- is_renovated = (yr_renovated > 0)
- years_since_renovation
- bath_bed_ratio = bathrooms / bedrooms
- total_sqft = sqft_living + sqft_basement
- living_lot_ratio = sqft_living / sqft_lot
```

### 4. 🤖 Model Training
- Train/test split (80/20)
- Robust scaling for feature normalization
- Linear regression with cross-validation

### 5. 📊 Model Evaluation
- Performance metrics calculation
- Residual analysis
